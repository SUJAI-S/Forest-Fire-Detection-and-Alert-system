The soil moisture sensor reads the soilâ€™s moisture, and once the soil moisture goes below a certain level, the LED turns ON as shown above.

` `**Final Conclusions:**

Overall, the mini project of detecting a forest fire served not just its initial purpose but also to create a substantive experience in translating theoretical concepts to applied life problems. The exposure-based learning made through the direct hands-on exposure was real-time observations of environmental monitoring technology and the utilisation of innovation in disaster management. Learning developed during conceptualising, constructing, and testing the system has been revealing and empowering.

The project is an exhibition of the strength of small-scale innovations, if well thought out, to create a monumental impact in addressing immediate global problems such as environmental protection and public security. It is also an exhibition of the strength of multidisciplinary solutions, where ideas of electronics, computer science, and environmental science come together to craft effective solutions.










## **RESULT:**
## Therefore, the IoT-enabled fire Detection and the alert system have been successfully designed and tested, as we are using FREERTOS (Real Time Operating System) based code <a name="interleaved_boost_power_factor_correctio"></a><a name="_bookmark18"></a><a name="matlab_simulation_and_results"></a><a name="_bookmark20"></a><a name="circuit_parameters_and_calculated_values"></a><a name="_bookmark21"></a><a name="matlab_code_and_simulation_"></a><a name="_bookmark23"></a><a name="different_connection_types"></a><a name="_bookmark28"></a><a name="fft_analysis"></a><a name="_bookmark30"></a>in order to make the system respond quickly to deal with the real-time scenarios efficiently.
